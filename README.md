# SectionMaterials

All assignments and section materials use Python3.6, with the anaconda distrition, without any extra dependencies. 

Note that these notebooks use some HTML tags for headers and so on that do not necessarily render properly on Github. Run the notebook locally to see how the notebooks should look.
